# Events

The domain must publish business level within its scope which other domains
may listen out and react accordingly. These events should be published to
[HMPPS Domain Events][hmpps-domain-events].

The domain may need to react to business events occurring outside its scope of
responsibility i.e. occurring in another domain. It is the responsibility of
this domain to listen out for events it is interested in and react according.
Events are skinny by default - a domain consuming an event may need to call
out to the publishing domain's API to obtain full data regarding the event.

## HMPPS Domain Events

Built using [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) and [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) in a [fanout configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sqs-as-subscriber.html), HMPPS domain events is a facility which enables choreographed processes across HMPPS systems.

Events must be published by all domains for all business-level changes.
