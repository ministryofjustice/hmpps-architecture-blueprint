# Domains

Domains define specific bounded areas of related functionality and data. A
domain service comprises the set of digital components required to address the
business requirements pertaining to a domain and store & maintain data
particular to that domain. A delivery team is responsible for
developing/procuring these digital components.

## Default Domain structure

The default structure should be sufficient to implement a domain in most cases
but alternative structures may be considered if deemed necessary.

An HLD should be produced for the domain - and must be produced if the domain
architecture deviates from the default.
