# HMPPS Digital Service Patterns

You can use these patterns to design an HMPPS Digital service that will seamlessly integrate with the HMPPS Digital platform. Application of these patterns in your service will shape the technical design to ensure it works with other platform components and can be monitored, managed and supported effectively within HMPPS Digital.

## Application Architecture

- [Separate UI and API/Business logic into separate application components](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)

## Hosting and Application Deployment
- [Host services on MoJ Cloud Platform](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)
- [Create application repositories using standard HMPPS tooling](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)
- [Deploy applications using HMPPS GitHub Actions templates](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)

## Monitoring and Alerting
- [Implement infrastructure-level monitoring and alerting using Cloud Platform](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)
- [Implement application-level alerting using Sentry](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)

## Analytics
- [Implement application analytics using Application Insights](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)
- [Implement user analytics using Application Insights 'Click Analytics'](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)

## Identity, Authentication and Authorisation
- [Implement user single sign-on using HMPPS Auth](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)

## Communication

### Outbound Communication
- [Publish HMPPS Domain Events to inform other services of important activity](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)
- [Publish APIs to provide other HMPPS services with detailed information](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)

### Inbound Communication
- [Consume HMPPS Domain Events to understand important activity across the estate](./hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html)
