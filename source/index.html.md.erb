# HMPPS Architecture Blueprint

## Background and Vision

>This formative document guides teams in delivering digital products and
>services into HMPPS. If documentation is missing or isn't clear, please [let
>us know](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C049XU1LR6W).

This user guide is for teams with applications or services deployed on, or
intending to deploy into the HMPPS digital platforms. It contains a set of
principles and patterns that can be used to design digital services. When
applied appropriately these patterns should ensure a digital service integrate
seamlessly with our digital platforms.

The HMPPS Digital platforms are conceived as a multi-tier, event-driven
ecosystem of integrated services which help drive prison and probation
processes and enable staff to make informed decisions. Over time the
implementation of domain focused digital services will displace older
monolithic systems as the authority for HMPPS administration and management.

## Architectural Principles and Patterns
All technical design should align to the MoJ and HMPPS
[Architectural Principles](documentation/explanation/principles-overview.html).

## The HMPPS Domain Model

We are business modelling and mapping to [HMPPS Domains](./documentation/explanation/domains.html)
based on the principles of Domain Driven Design

## HMPPS Digital Service Patterns

Services built using patterns chosen from a defined set of [HMPPS Digital Service Patterns](./documentation/patterns/hmpps-digital-service-patterns.html) will seamlessly integrate with the HMPPS Digital platforms.

## Roadmaps and Progression

We are in the process of performing large scale change on our technical environment. As this continues we are still actively managing an estate of [legacy services](./documentation/reference/legacy-systems.html) that are vital for day-to-day operation of the justice system. Our [indicative roadmaps](./documentation/reference/domain-roadmap.html) on the activity and progress of the modernisation of the HMPPS technical landscape show how we are developing our systems over time.
